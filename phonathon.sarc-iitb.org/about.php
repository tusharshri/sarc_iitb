					<p>It is an event, spread over few days (nights too), in which student of IITB have direct telephonic conversation with our alumni. Each Phonathon is conducted with a predefined goal at core and a lot of lively and fun-filled conversations surrounding it.</p>
					<p>General goals of phonathons consist of , publicizing various alumni events, updating alumni databases, in searching lost soul i.e. the alumni of IITB who are not in touch with us and keeping them updated about IITB.</p>
					<p>And the fun part being, the long extended conversations with the glorious students from old days. It is the best opportunity to see the difference between IITB then and what she has evolved now. Our cherished alumni share with us their memorable, sometimes notorious, adventures and experiences of their college days, pour invaluable words of wisdom and make us realize the importance of golden nest we are staying in.</p>
