<h3><b>What is Phonathon?</b></h3>
<p>
Phonathon provides a common interaction platform for 
students and alumni with an opportunity to connect over 
direct telephonic conversations. This helps in connecting 
alumni back to their alma mater, the connection can be 
manifolds, searching mentors for the Alumni Student 
Mentorship Program, publicizing various events amongst 
Alumni, updating alumni databases, invitation for reunions, 
fund raising and searching lost souls i.e. the alumni of 
IITB who are now not in touch with us, and keeping them 
updated about IITB.
