										<h2>What is ASMP ?</h2>
									</header>
									<p style="font-size:18px;">
									<span style="font-weight:bold;">Soon after entering the hallowed gates of <span style="color:black;"></span>IIT Bombay, most freshers are left wide eyed by the plethora of opportunities to prove and develop themselves; be it sports, cultural or academics.
However after the initial novelty wears off, students in their senior years are faced with the inevitable question: <span style="color:black;">“What next? Where will I be in the near future? What is life after IIT like?” </span>The answer to all these questions eventually boils to well informed guidance. It is for this very reason; the Student Alumni Relation Cell (SARC) has set up the <span style="color:black;">Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP) </span> on the lines of the highly successful Institute Student Mentorship Program (ISMP). ASMP is about using the experience & knowledge of our vast pool of distinguished alumni to guide our students. ASMP is a comprehensive, semester long program that seeks to foster meaningful and productive one-on-one relationships between students and alumni. </br>

<span style="font-size:30px;">1. Mentor@Intern </span> <span style="color:black;">: </br>With the aim of helping students who go on summer internships, Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC) has launched the Mentor@Intern Program in April 2013. The purpose of this initiative is to assist the students in getting settled with the alumnus acting as a mentor. The purpose of the introductory conversation is that the mentor and his/her protege get to know each other on personal and social basis. It helps in building the relationship and once the mentor is comfortable with mentee it also helps further. </p>
											<p>
<span style="font-size:30px;">2. Goal Setting </span><span style="color:black;">: </br></br>
 <span style="font-size:30px;">“Setting goals helps people strive to achieve”. </span></br></br>

<span style="font-size:25px;">Need:</span> </br>
In the previous phases of ASMP so far a common feedback that we have received from mentors is that most mentees are not certain on what is it that they seek to gain from their mentors through the program. This resulted in a dilution of the main aim of the program which is to help students realize their dreams through the help of mentors.Thus as part of our efforts to make the Alumni Student Mentorship Program more efficient and productive we have come up with the idea of Goal Setting. </br>

<span style="font-size:25px;">Purpose: </span> </br>

As part of this effort we try to get an idea from the mentee regarding what he expects to gain from his mentor through this mentorship program and convey the same to the mentor. After this is done the mentor and mentee decide 3 goals on which both of them work together. The advantages of this effort are, </br></br>

-It cuts out a clear path regarding how to proceed with future interactions. </br>

-Provides motivation to work together. </br>

-Helps mentees get proper results out of the program. </br>

-Helps improve the mentor’s mentorship experience. </br>

</span>

<span style="font-size:30px;">3. Speed Mentoring </span><span style="color:black;">:     </br>              For the last three years the Alumni Student Mentorship Program has been trying to help students of IIT Bombay by providing them with experienced alumni as mentors.Over these 3 years it has come to our notice that many students wish to gain some kind of exposure/knowledge of the various career fields they could get into. In our view no one but our alumni, who have been there and done that, could give a better insight into the finer details of every sector. Keeping this in mind, the Alumni Student Mentorship Program in collaboration with the Career Cell of IIT Bombay is proud to announce the launch of a new initiative - Speed Mentoring - from January 2014. The main focus of this initiative would be to help students have short one-to-one interactions with alumni who have excelled in different fields thus helping them get a better idea about the field. </span></p>		
											<p>
<span style="font-size:30px;">4. Photobooth </span><span style="color:black;">:  </br>This year, a new concept of Photobooth was introduced, where in a photo of mentee and mentor was clicked with a cool tagline</br></br>
<img src="images/photobooth.png"  alt="" />

<span style="font-size:30px;">6. Lighthouse of ASMP | Mentor Appreciation</span><span style="color:black;">: </br>Everyone of us has the potential to do wonders in our lives. But to realize that potential one needs to ignite that spark in oneself and that is where a mentor comes in.To help students of IIT-B realize their potential the Alumni Student Mentorship Program has been connecting them with our illustrious and esteemed alumni through the means of mentorship over the last 3 years. Over these years the program has been successful in bringing many of our alumni closer to the institute and has to some extent improved the link between the alumni and the students. This would not have been possible had it not been for the enthusiasm shown and unconditional support given by many of our alumni. Having recently concluded the third edition of the Student Alumni Meet the ASMP team would like to take this opportunity to thank and recognize the valuable efforts of two of our mentors - Mr.Ashok Kalbag and Mr.Sachin Chavan who have been with us right since the inception of this program.</br>
											</span></p>
											<p>
<span style="font-size:30px;">7. Break the Ice </span><span style="color:black;">: </br>
											The Student Alumni Meet(SAM), the single most important event of SARC during which we organize “Break the Ice” in which mentors and mentees interact over lunch. This event is held on the first weekend of October and provides an ideal platform for interaction with the alumni.</span></p></br>

<span>1. Out of the 273 mentees who had registered, 246 were allotted mentors. This decision was based on telephonic interviews of the sophomore undergraduates and 1sy year post graduate students, conducted by the Core Team of the Alumni Student Mentorship Programme.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="253" src="images/image08.png" width="448"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>2.

Most of the students were allotted their first preference of mentor. For those students whom we could not allot their first preference of mentors, they were allotted their 2nd preference, and so on. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="282" src="images/image06.png" width="473"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>4.

There were various goals which these 103 students achieved over a period of 4 months, the most common ones being insight into mentor&#39;s own academic portfolio, guidance on how to seek a job or internship in the field, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><img height="315" src="images/image01.png" width="756"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>5.
