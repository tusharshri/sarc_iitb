										<h2>What is Speed Mentoring ?</h2>
									</header>
									<p style="font-size:18px;">
									<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:black;">“Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen and a push in the right direction” </br>
 - John C.Crosby </br></span>
 Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP) was launched in January 2010 as an 
in-semester program to mend the link between students and alumni. With the aim of 
helping students who go on summer internships, Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC) has 
launched the <span style="color:black;">Mentor@Intern Program in April 2013</span>. An effort will be made to connect the 
students going for <span style="color:black;">summer internship</span> in a city, to the alumni based in that city. The purpose 
of this initiative is to assist the students in getting settled with the alumnus acting as a 
mentor. </br> </br>
 
<h2>This initiative emphasizes on:</h2><span style="font-weight:bold;"><p style="font-size:18px;">
<span style="color:black;">1.</span> Providing students a platform for one to one interaction 
with their esteemed alumni in the closest city </br></br>
 
<span style="color:black;">2.</span> Creating a valuable support system for students in the 
form of Alumni acting as mentors. </br></br>
 
<span style="color:black;">3.</span> Rendering students with career guidance. </br></br>
 
<span style="color:black;">4.</span> Tailoring them for their future endeavors. </br></br>
 
<span style="color:black;">5.</span> Catering to the betterment of alumni-student 
relationships by engaging them in fruitful conversations. </br></br></span> </p>

									<h2 class="major"><span id="testimonial">Testimonials of Past Mentors and Mentees</span></h2>
									<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;">
									<u>Mentor : Mr. Jyothin Madar </u></br></br>
									
									Interaction with your mentee : </span> </span></br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"Great. We chatted over coffee about jobs and the courses that would be useful to find a good job."</span></br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;">Suggestion or feedback : </span></span></br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"Good initiative... but only useful if the students make good use of it."</span> </br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;"><u>Mentor : Mr. Priyadarshan Gupta</u> </br></br>
									Interaction with your mentee : </span> </span></br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"Good. It was nice to know about the latest developments going on in the campus and see how things have evolved over the time."</span></br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;">Suggestion or feedback : </span></span></br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"ASMP I believe is doing a good job. By meeting the mentors, mentees can have a more realistic sneak peek into their future and take better decisions in the present." </span></br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;"><u>Mentee : Mr. Dhananjay Jolhe</u> </br></br>
									Interaction with you mentor :</span> </span> </br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"It was pretty good. We spoke about our interests, career, hobbies and a bit about how campus life has changed over the years."</span></br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;">Suggestion or feedback : </span></span></br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"It is a pretty good platform to expand your network, get in touch with alumni and know they're upto and correlate that with where you could go. If you want to take it to the next level, you could connect the students who've already met their allotted mentors (this is important for you guys, I know) a chance to meet some more/another alumni. I am sure there would be student who did not meet their mentors. So, such alumni could easily be allotted new and more interested mentees. Try to give this a chance, it shouldn't be logistically that problematic. Keep up the good work!!"</span> </br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;"><u>Mentee : Ms. Abhisha Srivastava</u></span> </br></br>
									<span style="font-size:25px;">Interaction with you mentor : </span></span> </br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"I mailed him and received no reply."</span></br></br>
									
									<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:25px;">Suggestion or feedback :</span> </span></br><span style="font-size:20px;">
									"Hats off to you guys! Awesome initiative. But I could not take much advantage of this programme because I was allotted a mentor more than 2 weeks after my internship has started. You find difficulty in a new city in the initial 1 week : finding a good place to stay is the most important task as soon as you land in a new city. But then I understand that it was your first time with this programme. I would suggest that you allot mentors about 2 weeks before the mentee starts his/her intern and you should ensure that the mentor has got in touch with the mentee as soon he/she is allotted a mentee."</span> </br> </span>

 <span style="color:black;">1. The allotment for the “Mentor@Intern” Initiative is done on the discretion of the ASMP team and 
keeping in mind various factors like geographical proximity, workplace etc. for the duration of the 
internship. Once done the allotment will be final and the ASMP Team will not entertain requests to 
change mentors during this duration of the internship. </br></br>
 
2. Mentors will be given basic details of the students who have been allotted to him/he. Hence kindly 
fill all the details with care. Any improper details undermining the credibility of the Programme will 
result in immediate disqualification. </br></br>
 
3. No personal requests/favors will be entertained by ASMP team regarding allotment of any 
particular mentor to any particular mentee. </br></br>
 
4. We expect the Mentee to initiate the interaction, and subsequently remain in contact through any 
means of communication. At the end of the internship, it is imperative that students and mentors 
provide feedback when contacted for the same. If an alumnus complains about lack of response the 
student will be warned and subsequently deregistered. </br></br>
 
5. The Mentor should not be asked for any kind of personal benefits like interns/placements for a 
later period. In case of such an incident, we request the mentor to communicate the same to us. </br></br>

6. We expect students to understand that alumni relations are very important for the 
institute so please do not do anything that can jeopardize these relations and take the 
above rules seriously. Violations of the above rules can result in the de registration of 
the concerned student.

The program was launched for the first time this year in the month of May,2013. A detailed report of the program has been shared below.</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Mentors registered : </span></span><span class="c6"><span style="font-size:20px;">40</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Mentees registered : </span><span class="c6"><span style="font-size:20px;">48</span></span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Duration of Program : </span><span class="c6"><span style="font-size:20px;">May 15 - End of Summer Break</span></span></span></p><a href="#" name="fb9fb93011ad78ca1e36c4c1e56fdf04d009bd67"></a><a href="#" name="0"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c7"><tbody></tbody></table><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><a href="#" name="fb9fb93011ad78ca1e36c4c1e56fdf04d009bd67"></a><a href="#" name="1"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c7"><tbody></tbody></table><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5"><span style="font-size:30px;">Pre-Mentor@Intern Activities:</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Before the program was officially launched mails were sent on April 17 to all the students regarding </span><span class="c6 c5">Mentor@Intern</span><span class="c6">. Based on the responses that we got, we sent mails to the Alumni giving them a basic idea about the initiative and what was expected of them as a mentor, along with the links for registration. The necessary mentor details that we required for this were obtained from the past mentors database of ASMP. Once a list of mentors and mentees were obtained we started the allotment process which was done manually. The criteria on the basis of which the allotment was done are,</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">1. City of Internship</span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">2. Department</span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">3. Company of Internship</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In most of the cases every mentor was allotted only one mentee. But in those cases where the number of mentors were much lower than the number of mentees multiple mentees were allotted to mentors based on the consent of the mentors. After the allotment was done we sent mails to both the mentors and mentees informing them about the allotment. In these mails we also shared the profiles of both the mentor and mentee with each other and encouraged them to start interactions at the earliest.Another important effort done by us in order to give both the mentees and the mentors a complete idea about the program - A Handbook,</span><span class="c6 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;prepared by our team : </br></br></span><span class="c4"><a class="c2 c1" href="http://asmp.sarc-iitb.org/mentor@intern/MenteeBrochureFinal.pdf"><span style="color:black;">http://asmp.sarc-iitb.org/mentor@intern/MenteeBrochureFinal.pdf</span></a></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5"><span style="font-size:30px;">Activity done during Mentor@Intern:</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Once the allotment was done and the mails were sent we called the mentees during the last week of May to ensure that interactions had started between the mentees and mentors. As part of our follow-up we send mails to those who had not started interacting yet to make sure that they start interacting. We called these mentees once again in the first week of June. The final statistics of the number of students who have started interacting with their mentor is as follows,</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Mentees contacted : </span><span class="c6">39</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Mentees who were not reachable &nbsp;: </span><span class="c6">9</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Mentees who have started interacting : </span><span class="c6">20</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5"><span style="font-size:20px;">Mentees who have not started interacting : </span><span class="c6">19</span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Towards the end of the program feedback mails were sent on 10th July to both mentees and mentors.</span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5"><span style="font-size:30px;">Challenges faced and improvements to be done:</span></span></p><p class="c2 c1"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><ol class="c3 lst-kix_ny3obn5ib464-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c6">1.
