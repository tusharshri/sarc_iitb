                            <p>As part of our continuous efforts to keep the Alumni involved in the growth of our institution and in order to bring together closer both the current students and the alumni,<b> SARC</b> started an initiative known as the <b>Mentor@Intern</b> on the lines of the <b>Alumni Student Mentorship Program</b>. The aim of this program was to help internship students settle down in their new work environment with the help of our esteemed Alumni by their side during every step of their struggle. The program was launched for the first time this year in the month of May,2013. A detailed report of the program has been shared below</p>

                                <li>Mentees registered : 48</li>
 <li>Duration of Program : May 15-end of summer break</li>
                                <li>mentees who have started interacting and gave good feedbacks : 20</li>

                                <li>Lots of mentees did not interact because they felt that they were already well settled in the city of their internship by the time they were allotted mentors and so it was difficult to convince them to interact with their mentors </li>
                                <li>As the allotment was done manually this year, many people suggested that the allotment be made better i.e. to give more priority to sector in which the alumnus works rather than his/her department.These changes will be incorporated in the coming phase</li>
 <li>In this phase we were not able to include the foreign internship students which we aim to do in the next phase</li>
                                <li>Depending on the feedback may think of extending the program in the winter-phase as well</li>

                                <li>Through the program we have managed to take student-Alumni relations to a higher level </li>
                                <li>With the launch of Mentor@intern we have managed to make the mentorship program a yearlong affair</li>
 <li>In the very first phase, we have had 20 successful interactions out of 48 with some of these interactions being so fruitful that some mentees have suggested that they would wish to continue their interactions even after the phase gets over</li>
                                <li>Through this program we have managed to realize the biggest goal of SARC i.e. improving the network of students with the Alumni</li>
