<p>Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP) was launched in January 2010 as an in-semester program to mend the link between students and alumni. With the aim of helping students who go on summer internships, Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC) has launched the Mentor@Intern Program in April 2013. An effort will be made to connect the students going for summer internship in a city, to the alumni based in that city. The purpose of this initiative is to assist the students in getting settled with the alumnus acting as a mentor.
