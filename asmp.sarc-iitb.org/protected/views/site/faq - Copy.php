  <p style="color:blue;">2.   How are mentoring pairs made?  </p>
  <p>After students register with the program, filling in their preference and other details. We provide students a mentor of the same preference and whose preference matches with him. The mentor might be of different department if the student has filled a non-core sector. Else if the student has filled preference as core then accordingly his pairs will be made</p>
