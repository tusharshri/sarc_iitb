<p class='desc'>The quote very precisely sums up what ASMP stands for.</p>
                    <p>This program initiated by the Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC), IITB aims at improving the Alumni network within the institute and brings closer the students and the esteemed and experienced alumni. The alumni would aid students as they walk those same paths, be a beacon to light the way ahead through their wisdom and experience they garnered by confronting the ground realities of the world. The students at every point stand at the threshold of limitless possibilities, but a mentor&apos;s insight would help them streamline their priorities and goals and thus bridge the gap between the outside and inside world. Alumni with their modest investment of time will not only develop long lasting relations, have more intimate connection with their college but they will also have the  satisfaction of having contributed to the comfort and education of future generation of IITians.</p>
<p>ASMP believes that a close and continuous connection with an alumnus will help in the overall development of the students who choose to participate in the program. To this end, since the program&apos;s inception, applicants have been matched with alumni mentor based on common goals and career interests. ASMP provides students with a mentor for a semester only. In October, mentors and mentees are invited to meet each other at &apos;<strong>Break The Ice</strong>&apos; Event hosted at IITB to facilitate one to one mentor-mentee interaction in person and thus foster mentor- mentee relations. Throughout the semester, mentor alumni are free to offer their mentees assistance in whatever way they choose.</p> 
<p>Beginning this summer, ASMP has another addition to give students an opportunity to interact with and to form long term relationships with IITB alumni mentor. <strong>Mentor@Intern</strong> is a pilot program introduced to help interns in their stay during the internship. Interns are provided with mentors,who are alumni in the city in which they are doing their internship. Students will undoubtedly benefit from the valuable advice and perspective of their mentor which will enhance their work/research experience</p>
<p>Thus in all its programs, ASMP provides the students of IIT-B the opportunity of fostering a strong and lasting relationship with friends with a little more experience!</p>
<b><p>ASMP is looking to expand their pool of alumni involved.If you are interested to be a mentor, or have suggestions for other ways that could help IITB students, </p></b>
