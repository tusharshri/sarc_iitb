      <span class="title">Break the Ice</span> 
      <div class="content">As the name suggests, it is an ice-breaking session kept for mentors and mentees who are part of the Alumni Student Mentorship Program.

Around 100 alumni and 500+ students are expected for this event.</div>

      <div class="content">Questions about what career path to choose, the growth and prospects in any sector become the thoughts that hound everyone. To help students overcome these uncertainties, alumni from core and non core sectors are invited to give an informal talk on their respective fields, enlightening the students about the career choices and what they are in for in that line of work. </div>

      <span class="title">Sports Meet</span>
      <div class="content">"Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best". This quote   perfectly fits the enthralling display of experience, wit and never say die attitude of the alumni at the Alumni Sports Day. The Annual Alumni Sports Day witnesses tremendous competition between the energy of the present generation and that of the alumni. The sports meet is spread over 2 days and includes events like Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Chess, Hockey, Lawn Tennis, Volleyball where current students and alumni can face off against each other.</div>

      <div class="content">Beyond the Horizon is an interaction with unconventional alumni who thought out-of-the-box and followed their dreams and took a different route. The session aims at providing the students a subconscious support through the examples of young trailblazers, inspiring them to become the future torchbearers.</div>

        <li tabindex="1">
      <span class="title">Cultural Meet</span> 
      <div class="content">Cultural activities on campus have always been a great way to develop new skills and find recreation. Be it the PAFs or the inter-hostel rivalry in GCs, the campus has always had a rich cultural atmosphere. Here, Alumni who have actively participated in cultural events during their stay at IIT Bombay are invited to perform alongside students in a non competitive environment. The cultural meet is a great place to witness some of the best performances from both students and alumni who have always made the stage their own.</div>
