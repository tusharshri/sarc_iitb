		<h2>Hostel Alumni Team Stewardship (HATS)</h2>
                  <p> HATS is an important alumni-driven initiative that aims to channel the affinity and affection that many alumni have for their Hostels. HATS started with the Hostel 7 campaign "In Service of the Lady" in 2006, and continued with the Hostel 4 HATS campaign which launched with a bang in 2009. Under the leadership of an enthusiastic "core team", HATS will leverage the past successes to develop a campaign for all hostels.
