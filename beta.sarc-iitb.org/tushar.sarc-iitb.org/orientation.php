    <p>Stand up comedian and CEO of HUMOROUSLY YOURS, is an Electrical Engineering graduate from IIT Bombay. Fresh out of college, he worked as a retail analyst in Adventity Inc. for 6 months, but soon realised that his heart was in H.R. (HUMOR Resources). He mixed Laughs &amp; Entrepreneurship and soon founded the most Unique HR firm &quot;Humorously Yours&quot; which has since been pioneers in Stand Up Comedy &amp; Entertainment Shows.<br />
      Within a very short span of time he has entertained the audience at all the major public platforms ranging from college festivals in India (IITs, IIMs) to their alumni meets, from the prestigious Comedy Store Mumbai to city concerts during Hyderabad Comedy Fest 2011. Given his originality and clean witty content he is the most sought after stand up comic for the major corporate houses, TATA Communications, HDFC Ergo, Fractal Analytics, Cognizant, Ferrero Rocher to name a few. Given the popularity of his videos on youtube, facebook and other social media platforms, the Business Line magazine nicknamed him as &quot;Viral Goyal&quot; and also labelled his stand up gig about facebook as the &quot;Kolaveri Di of stand up comedy&quot;. As he humorously puts it, he has the distinction of being the only stand up comic in India who performs in 4 different languages, English, Hindi, Java and C++.</p>
