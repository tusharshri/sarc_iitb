	<h2>Registration and Allotment procedure</h2>
	<ol start="1" type="1">
		<li>The students would have to fill in their Details(Department, Batch, Hostel, Contact information along with other details) along with a <b>Statement of Purpose</b> (mentioning your career interests and expectations out of this program).<br/>
		 In the last step of registration, the list of all the registered mentors(Displaying their Professional information) would be made visible to the students. <br/>
		 The students are expected to select and rank those mentors which match their career interests as per their preference.<br/>
		 The allotment will depend on the choices of both mentee and mentor. <b>Each mentee can request at max 10 mentors.</b> 
		 </li>
		<li> The profile of the mentor will carry the following information 
				<style>
				#mentor_info li{
					line-height: 15px;
					font-size:12px;
				}
				</style>
				<ul id="mentor_info" type="none" style="list-style-image: none;margin: 5px;">
					<li>Department</li>
					<li>Passing out year</li>
					<li>Designation</li>
					<li>Company</li>
					<li>Industry</li>
					<li>Work Profile</li> 
					<li>City</li>
				</ul>

		<span style="color:#FF4444; line-height: 15px;">Choose those mentors who match your interests and suit your requirements so as to be the appropiate guide for you.<span>
		</li>
		<li> Your preferences will be kept in mind while allotting; however please keep in mind that any of these selected mentors can be allotted to you. Hence prefer only those mentors whom you would be genuinely interested in interacting with.
		<li> Once 10 mentees have chosen a particular mentor, the mentor will be immediately locked. <b>Hence we urge you to register at the earliest to have a wider pool of mentors to choose from.</b>
		<li> Once the mentor is locked 5 more students can still request him but they will be considered in the wait list and preferred after the first ten students. (We advice against this, selecting from the available mentors would be a better option.)
		<li> After the registration, list of those mentees who have requested a mentor will be sent to that particular mentor. The mentor will in turn send back his/ her preferences with regard to the mentees. <b>(Mentor will give importance to your SoP along with other details while preferring. Thus, we suggest you be ready with your SoP in advance.)</b>
		<li><b>The allotments are subjected to availability of mentors. </b>
		<li> Final allotments will be done by the ASMP Team on the basis of both the mentees and mentors preferences. Once done the allotment will be final and the ASMP Team will not entertain any requests to change mentor in the same phase. You may choose to select a different mentor in the next phase.
