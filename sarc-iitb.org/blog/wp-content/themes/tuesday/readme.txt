== Description ==
Tuesday is responsive and customizable theme. It's inspired from minimal and flat design. Choose between three available layouts and add blog logo. The theme allows you to control your typography. With font settings you can choose the font you like from Google Web Fonts, and use it instantly on your blog. Tuesday supports header images and background settings.
The theme also adds two new widgets, and it's optimized for phones and tablets.

== What is coming soon? ==
First on the list is post formats redesign. I need some time to check what improvements WordPress 3.6 brings, so I can use them to offer nice post formats look.
Other improvements include:
- New comment form
- Adding more functionality to 'Tuesday Recent Posts' widget, like manually setting which posts to be shown instead of showing only recent.
- Code improvements
And maybe more, depending on user feedback.

== Changelog ==

== Known bugs ==
- Past uploaded logo images not showing in 'Uploaded' tab
- [Mobile] CSS Transform makes the element flick on iOS Safari
- [Mobile] Ugly sidebar on single article view
- [Mobile] Sidebar on right layout works like 'on left'
