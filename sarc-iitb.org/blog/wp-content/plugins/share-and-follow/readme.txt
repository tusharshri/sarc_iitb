== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

It can be installed in two ways, firstly by downloading the plugin from the Wordpress directory website or by via the Wordpress admin page for adding a new plugin

Downloading from Wordpress Website

1. Download the plugin from the wordpress plugin directory
2. Unzip the plugin
3. Upload `/share-and-follow/` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Administer it from the 'Settings' menu using the 'Share and Follow' menu item

Using the Wordpress Admin page for installing

1. Go to the admin page and select the 'Plugins' menu, using the 'Add new' menu item
2. Search for 'share and follow'
3. Select install for the plugin 'Share and Follow' by Andy Killen
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Installing Plugin' page in WordPress
5. Administer it from the 'Settings' menu using the 'Share and Follow' menu item


**important** you must fill out the Follow links in the Share and Follow admin page for any follow link to display except RSS.  The RSS link is the standard one for your site, however you will need to enter your own links for your Fcebook fan page, YouTube Channel and other follow links.  If you leave the links blank the system will not display the icons or text on your pages/posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Why the CDN stuff? =

We were often requested to make more icon sets available to users of the plugin.  We wanted to do this, and allowed people to replace the icons within the directory structre from the very start, but now we are moving to sprites for speed, those options are not available.
If you couple that with the fact that most users of wordpress and share and follow are using both of them as it stops them having to workout these things like a HTML coder would. They want the easy life, and so they should.  Computers and websites should not be difficult.

So we have responeded in the best way we know.  Rather than getting people to download stuff, or ubn-zip things, or even FTP, we thought we would cut out all of that horribleness by implementing a Content Delivery Network, where all the files for the icons are actually located on
a group of server around the world. So no matter where you or where your reader is, there is a CDN thingy there as well, delivering the images and icons. The beauty of a CDN is that it is ultra fast, and holds all the files, all you need to do to access them is to get the subscription key to unlock the menu [from our website](https://www.share-and-follow.com/cdn-subscription/) .
Once unlocked you can choose which every icon set we have on the list and update the settings and your done.  Simple stuff.

= Is the CDN compulsory? =

No definitly not, it is an optional extra that we have developed and invested in so that you can have more choice. After all it was what you the users asked for. 
You don't have to join it you want, but if you do you will have access to all sorts of extra icon sets, all with 1 click to change your site.

= How much does the CDN cost? =
We offer it in either subscription form if you have upto 100,000 visitors per month, or in special manged solution for WebMasters, Web Hosting companies & Enterprise multi-domain facilities.

The Yearly subscriptions:

* upto 5,000 visitors per month = 9,99euro per year
* upto 10,000 visitors per month = 18,50euro per year
* upto 25,000 visitors per month = 45,00euro per year
* upto 50,000 visitors per month = 85,00euro per year
* upto 100,000 visitors per month = 160,00euro per year

Monthly invoiced charging available for multi-domain, hosting companies and ultra busy sites. [Contact us](http://www.share-and-follow.com/contact/) for more information

= I'm getting fopen errors =

you need to use your FTP client to make sure that the two files

/wp-content/plugins/share-and-follow/css/stylesheet.css
/wp-content/plugins/share-and-follow/css/print.css

are both set with the permissions of 664.  If this does not work, try 777 (hammer to crack a nut)

One way of doing this is with Filezilla the free FTP client

* open your website using FTP and Filzilla
* change to the /wp-content/plugins/share-and-follow/css/ directory
* right click on the file stylesheet.css and choose permissions
* set the number to be 664 and say ok
* do the same for print.css

= the screen does not change when I change my settings =

First check the permission for the StyleSheet files. See the above answer for an full explantion on how to do this with Filezilla, the free FTP client.

= Does this system use Javascript? =

Only on the link for MySpace Sharing,  it uses a javascript to open a nice window rather than a whole tab.  There is no other javascript used.  It does not load jquery or any other framework.

= Does phat reaction (makers of the plugin) or any other party collect stats about link clicks? =

We do not save any data about your links and if they are clicked. This means that your business is your own, you are not giving away a part of it to a 3rd party.

= What size icons can I use? =

You can any of the following sizes 16X16px, 24X24px, 32X32px, 48X48px, 60X60px

= How does it stop me loosing pagerank and why is that important? =

The plugin has the item rel="nofollow" item inside each of the links that are placed on a page.  This means that when the google bot comes to your site it will not follow those links and give them a part of your pagerank.  Your pagerank is important to you as it will place you higher in google organic rankings when it is higher than other information sources or your competitors.

= How does the Follow tab work =

The plugin adds a DIV at the bottom of the HTML just before the closing body tag, this div element is positioned absolutely in the place that you want, Top - Bottom - Left - Right.

* **Top :** If placed at the top of the page it also adds padding of the same height to the Body element, pushing your content down. There is no text replacement available, use CSS to style. Use #follow in CSS
* **Bottom :** If placed at the bottom of the page, there is no text replacement available as you can style your own text via CSS (use your theme CSS for best results). Use #follow in CSS
* **Left :** Places a tab on the left of the screen.  Icon only or Text replacement available (vertical text)
* **Right :** Places a tab on the Right of the screen.  Icon only or Text replacement available (vertical text)

= Does the Follow tab or the addition of share links to the bottom of posts and pages effect the widgets? =

No they all function independently. You can turn on an off each element as you like.  However for any of the Follow links to work, you will need to enter your details into the admin screen, using 'Settings' menu and the 'Share and Follow' menu item

= Can I have different widget configuration on different sidebars? =

The widgets are setup to allow you to use it differently on every sidebar you have, or the same on all.  They can be implemented on many sidebars at once.

= Does the share links have to display on every page and post? =

Nope you have quite a lot of control.  You can choose to show it or not show it on

* posts
* pages
* homepage
* archive pages such as tags, catalog, archive, date

Also you can exclude pages just by entering them in a comma seperated list. 

= Where do the icons come from ? =

For the default icon set it is a mix of [komodo social networking pack](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/) and [Social.me icon pack](http://jwloh.deviantart.com/art/Social-me-90694011) from jwhol, and some added icons created by Andy Killen.  All other sets are made by Neville Raven.

== Usage ==
= Setting up the Share Links in admin screen =

To configure the Share links in the admin screen, you will need to login as an administrator of your wordpress system.
Once logged into the admin screen of your wordpress, go to the *'Settings'* menu and then the *'Share and Follow'* menu item.

The Share options are at the Top of the screen (on the left if you are viewing in HD), in this section you can choose the settings of the automatically added links to all pages and posts.  The settings you can configure here are

* If the automatically added links display at all. there is a radio button to turn them on and off
* The Style of the link is offered as a drop down list.
* The Size of icons to use as a drop down list (16, 24, 32, 48 and 60px)
* The spacing in PX between your links
* The links to display as a checkbox on/off
* If it should display the word 'share' as a prefix to the icon list as a checkbox.
* The text of the links to display as a text entry

Once you have changed it all to be how you want, click the update settings box.

**important**  this only manages the automatically added share links, not any other kind (i.e. widget or function share options).

= Setting up the Follow Links in admin screen =

To configure the Follow links in the admin screen, you will need to login as an administrator of your wordpress system.
Once logged into the admin screen of your wordpress, go to the *'Settings'* menu and then the *'Share and Follow'* menu item.

The Follow options are in the middle that page (on the right if you are viewing in HD), in this section you can choose the settings of the Follow links to all web pages.  The settings you can configure here are

* If the Follow tab should be show at all. You can turn it on and off with the radio button
* The background and the border color of the Follow tab as text box entries (do not include the # in the HEX color number)
* The location on screen of the Follow tab is setup with a drop down list (top/bottom/left/right)
* The dispaly Style can be setup with a drop down list (Icon only, Text only, Text and Icon or Text replacement)
* The Follow word on text replacement the color it should be is setup with a drop down list
* The size of the icons 16, 24, 32, 48, 60 px as a drop down list
* Which links to display as a checkbox on/off
* What the links should say as textbox input
* Where the links should go as a textbox input

Once you have changed it all to be how you want, click the update settings box.

**important** none of the follow links except RSS will show until you have setup the Follow links setion here.

= Putting this plugin into a Wordpress Theme =

There are seven ways of implementing this plugin directly into a theme, you can either use the simplified functions of the_share_links(), my_share_links(), get_the_share_links() or my_follow_links().  Please see the [share and follow website](http://share-and-follow.com/wordpress-plugin/share-and-follow-wordpress-plugin-documentation/implementing-the-share-links-into-a-theme/)

= Using the plugin as a shortcode directly in the post or page =

Yes there is a short code available *[share_links]*, it can be placed into any post or page in the Visual or HTML tab.  Check the [website for the latest details on the [share_links] shortcode](http://share-and-follow.com/wordpress-plugin/share-and-follow-wordpress-plugin-documentation/using-the-shortcode-in-a-page-or-post/)

= Share URL Images =

By configuring the admin screen for Share URL images, the system will setup default images that social networks like Facebook will default to in their Newsfeed and share URL applications.

The system can use a defaul gravatar image, dynamic gravatar based on author, a site logo, an image from the page or if wanted a default image for posts, pages, homepage or archive pages.

The on screen admin page has comprehensive instructions on it.
