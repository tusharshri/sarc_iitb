Send a notification on comment to the author of the post

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that sends notifications to post's author when someone writes a comment to the post. This is helpful for blogs with many authors that writes on different topics.
The message sent is the same message sent from wordpress to the administrator (if you check that option), it's exactly the same code. This means that in the message the you already have the links to allow or discard the comment. 
Another bonus from using the same code of wordpress base is that it's easier to translate the message in your native language bacause you can use the translation file for wordpress and take the translated template.

NEW: now we added a notification panel where you can:
choose if you want to be notified only when the comment requires moderation or everytime a comment is added
setup the email template using a super template language

== Installation ==

1. Upload `NotifyOnComment.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's all
4. Check the administration panel of the plugin to change the plugin behaviour
