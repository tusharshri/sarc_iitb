Version 2.1 replaces images/index.htm with a blank HTML page

Version 2.0: The Follow Me plugin was updated in Version 2.0 to allow users to stick the widget on the side of their website. Along with that we included new pop-up functionality that displays all of your social profiles with large icons. 
We also included in this update the ability to add your Google buzz profile along with an RSS icon.

Old Version: The Follow Me widget allows you to display links to all your social media profiles in one, easy-to-access button or window.

== Installation ==

your old instaces of links out to your different social profiles and re-add them.
