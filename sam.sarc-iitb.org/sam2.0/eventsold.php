<!-- Break The Ice-->
		As the name suggests, it is an ice-breaking session kept for mentors and mentees who are part of the Alumni Student Mentorship Program. Over lunch, mentors and their mentees have a face-to-face interaction and get to know one another thus breaking any inhibitions whatsoever. Around 100 alumni and 500+ students are expected for this event.

	<!-- Buddy Talks --->
    	Questions about what path to choose, the growth and prospects in any sector become the thoughts that hound everyone. To help students overcome these uncertainties, alumni are invited to give an informal talk on their respective sectors, enlightening the students about the career choices and what they are in for in that line of work.
Keeping in mind the huge success of these talk during last year, we plan to hold it yet again this year. However, this time, we are extending them to core sectors as well.

	<div id="panel-discussion">
		<p>
	<!-- Panel Discussion -->	A panel consisting of alumni, faculty and student representative is invited to discuss on a student centric topic. Thought provoking debates on some of the most despised, desired and debated topics in the institute today makes this an event not to be missed. 
</p>
	</div>
    <div id="bth">
		<p>
	<!--Beyond the Horizon-->	Beyond the Horizon is an interaction with unconventional alumni who thought out-of-the-box and followed their dreams and took a different route. The session aimed at providing the students a subconscious support through the examples of young trailblazers, inspiring them to become the future torchbearers.
	</p>
	</div>
     <div id="mock-interviews">
		<p>
	<!--Mock interview-->	This year we are planning a new event with the vision that passing out students can be benefited by experiencing mock interviews by alumni before they sit for their actual interviews.
	</p>
	</div>
     <div id="great-minds">
		<p>
	<!--Great Minds-->	Similar to the panel discussion, this is the new event we are thinking this year. We wish to hold a discussion on a topic with far reaching consequences. SAM will be a platform for alumni to gather and discuss and debate on topics that matter. Suggestions are precious and we welcome any thoughts and ideas you have regarding this event.
</p>
	</div>
     <div id="cult-events">
		<p>
	<!--Get That Foot Tapping-->	Cultural activities on campus have always been a great way to develop new skills and find recreation. Be it the PAFs or the inter-hostel rivalry in GCs, the campus has always had a rich cultural atmosphere. We plan to have a reunion of sorts of alumni who participated in cultural events during their days, along with interaction with student, while reminiscing their own stint with cultural activities.
What we have thought of are informal events, jam sessions, competitions, interactive sessions and cultural performances from both students and alumni to witness some of the finest performers, both present and past, who have always made the stage their own!
Since this event is being planned for the first time, we invite suggestions and feedback from your end too.	</div>

	<!--Put on Your Running Shoes--> ""Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best". This quote   perfectly fits the enthralling display of experience, wit and never say die attitude of the alumni at the Alumni Sports Day. The Annual Alumni Sports Day witnessed tremendous competition between the energy of the present generation and that of the alumni in last 2 years. Alumni showed the perfect blend of attitude, experience and sporting spirit with some exceptional performances in all the sports. Results of last yearâ€™s meet like the previous year were pretty much dominated by the alumni, winning in almost all the sports (this year we are going to give you a tough fight) This year we are planning to conduct it over 2 days with some additional informal events like Arm wrestling, Relay crossy Battle of the Batches and some more. Sports that are taking place :- Athletics, Badminton, Basketball,Cricket, Football, Chess, Hockey, Lawn Tennis, Volleyball.
It will be very helpful to us in making this Alumni Sports day a grand success if suggestions and inputs come from the  Alumni. Looking forward to saying "Hello sir !" to you ! 	 </p>
