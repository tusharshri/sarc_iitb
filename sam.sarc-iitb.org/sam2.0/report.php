<h2 align="center"> Student Alumni Meet 2.0 </h2>

<br/><p class="main">Student Alumni Relations Cell (<b>SARC</b>) organised the 2nd Student Alumni Meet (SAM) on the 6th and 7th of October with great fanfare. It was an all-inclusive festival aimed at bridging the gap between the students and the alumni, with a variety of events being organised over the stretch of 2 days. The pre-event online game &ldquo;<b>SARCasm</b>&rdquo; and the institute wide publicity with posters and flexes ensured a reasonably good buzz and wide participation, including even  by the PG students. </p>

<p class="main">SAM took a giant leap in terms of the scale of the event by including various clubs and bodies across the institute. Not surprisingly, the events practically covered all aspects of the relation building with the alumni. In this regard, several initiatives in form of events such as &ldquo;<b>Core Weekend</b>&rdquo;, conducted in collaboration with the Career Cell (part of the Academic Council), and &ldquo;<b>Mock Interviews</b>&rdquo; (a workshop and interview session in collaboration with the Institute Placement Team) covered the career ambitions of the students and how to pursue them. With the ideology that alumni are the most treasured institute resources for experience and wisdom sharing, both the sessions were very well received. As an extension of academics, a &ldquo;<b>Tech fair</b>&rdquo; was organised on both the days for alumni visitors to gain insight into the level and scale of technical activities and projects students involve themselves in outside the classroom.</p>

<p class="main">To abandon the path of a traditional corporate career that most IITians choose, a session on &ldquo;<b>Beyond The Horizon</b>&rdquo; was organised to display the courage and involvement of alumni whoâ€™ve followed their heart and passion and made a living out of it. With alumni belonging to a variety of domains ranging from social activists to health care experts, mountaineering enthusiasts to  artists, the sessions provided a refreshingly diverse perspective to the students. This was followed by an equally engaging Q&A session, with students asking the alumni the source of their motivation and enthusiasm. Another session on &ldquo;<b>Power of Innovation</b>&rdquo; left the audience enthused on how they could easily build another Facebook or Google from India if only they resorted to critical thinking and followed the same scientific approach that their professors inculcate in the IITB classrooms. </p>

<p class="main">On the lighter side, the &ldquo;<b>Sports Meet</b>&rdquo;, previously known as &ldquo;SPASM&rdquo;, was inculcated into the SAM structure and similar events and sports competitions were organised. The role of the SARC team and Sports Council, working in cohesion, was instrumental in managing the large scale meet. Though the mid-October thunders and rains washed out several outdoor games, indoor games such as basketball, played in the new Syntel Gymkhana, kept the  sportsman spirit running high; students (both boys and girls) squared off against their  alumni counterparts. In the broader perspective, a foundation to the first Institute Basketball League was also laid. </p>

<p class="main">In Parallel, cultural interactive sessions were organised to involve alumni and their family with students to mutually learn and enjoy performing and non-performing arts in a non-competitive environment, as part of the &ldquo;<b>Cultural Meet</b>&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="main">The ASMP Mentor-Mentee lunch served to &ldquo;<b>Break The Ice</b>&rdquo; and continued the legacy from last year as being the exclusive platform forface-to-face interaction of the student-alumni pairs. Both days saw a significant participation from both parties. All speculation and doubt regarding the requirement of such an event was laid to rest when mentors from previous phases also came down to meet their mentees of last year. This was undoubtedly the biggest USP of the event and strengthened the ground-breaking  concept that the best discussions happen over a full stomach!</p>

<p class="main">The second half of Day 2 had a <b>stand-up comedy</b> performance by Rivaldo followed by a Q&A and interactive session as to how and what led a student to move from an &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; to an &ldquo;entertainment engineer&rdquo;. One of the memorable quotes from the session by Rivaldo was,&ldquo;I was a shy person. But the stage takes away the shyness and has built a confidence in me which nothing else in my life could&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="main">The event came to an end with the flagship event- the &ldquo;<b>Panel Discussion</b>&rdquo; on &ldquo;The Unfulfilled Dream: Vision Behind the IITs&rdquo;. With an elite panel including Prof Phatak and Mr Satish Joshi among the seniors and Antariksh Bothale among the recent graduates, the discussion saw wider participation with both student and faculty forming a part of the audience. The enriching discussion on the structure and contribution of IITB to society and the nation was beautifully depicted with collective contribution from the panellists and the audience.</p>

<p class="main">With this, the Student Alumni Meet ended on a high, laying the foundation of a phenomenon serving as the biggest platform for such large scale student and alumni interaction and leaving behind an unprecedented legacy of coming together and jointly celebrating the IITBian of yesterday and today. In due course of time, the SAM is bound to become the most anticipated meet of the year by all stakeholders of IIT Bombay, &#45;be it students, faculty or alumni !!</p>
