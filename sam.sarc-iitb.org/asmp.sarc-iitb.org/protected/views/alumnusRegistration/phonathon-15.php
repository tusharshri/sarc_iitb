      <p>Every Phonathon this year, was an improvement over the previous one, and Phonathon XV was no different.We've constantly improved efficiency and cut down on costs incurred over the year.Phonathon XV was a yet another experiment for weekend calling to India based alumni, considering the successful hit rate on weekends, which is evident from the following statistics. Conducted over 2 weekends on 3rd-4th March and 17th-18th March, from 10 AM to 5 PM. </p>

  <div>Of course, some people are generally very enthusiastic and excited, and ask for mailing for &quot;All&quot; details. We had 200 such people as well.</div>
  <div>
    <p>The total mails already sent counted to 529.<br />  
      Some analysis of the above data is required:<br />1) Even though conducted for 4 days (effectively 3 - the first Saturday was wiped out because of serious trouble with the database),large number of calls were attempted, particularly due to an increased number of volunteers yet again - 51 compared to 41 last time
      <br /> 2) High hit rate due to weekend calling - people had time to take calls and talk</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>We are extremely thankful to Dean ACR office for providing us their office as Phonathon venue, particularly due to last moment changes in non-availability of our venue in the institute.</p>
<p>I'm sure our team is not out of ideas, and we have plans to further improve the efficiency of Phonathons, with even better results.</p>
