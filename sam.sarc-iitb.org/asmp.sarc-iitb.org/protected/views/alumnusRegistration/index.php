<p>Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. With the aim of mending the broken link between students and alumni, <b>Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC)</b> came up with an idea of <b>Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP)</b>. <br />
  <br />
The mission of the program is two fold: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To furnish alumnus with a platform to interact with the students on a one to one basis. And connect them with the Institute.</li>
  <li>To provide students with career and academic advice and prepare themselves for the graduation and to face the real world.</li>
</ul>
<br />
As a mentor you can
<ul>
  <li><b>Stay connected</b> with the institute and know about the IIT of today.</li>
  <li><b>Help students</b> in reaching their professional goals.</li>
  <li>Develop <b>long lasting relations</b> enhancing your professional network.</li>
</ul>
