                Resume is not for comparison between students but for efficient allotment of students to alumni by the ASMP team. Also, the same will be forwarded to your mentor as your background information.
            </li>

               Resume does not necessarily has to be in the formal standard format but it is appreciated if you provide a formal one as it will be really helpful for our mentors.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the SOP you should mention your career interests, expectations out of this program and your mentor.
