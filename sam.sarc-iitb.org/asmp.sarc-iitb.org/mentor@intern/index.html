                            <p>Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP) was launched in January 2010 as an in-semester program to mend the link between students and alumni. With the aim of helping students who go on summer internships, Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC) has launched the Mentor@Intern Program in April 2013. An effort will be made to connect the students going for summer internship in a city, to the alumni based in that city.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of this initiative is to assist the students in getting settled with the alumnus acting as a mentor. The purpose of the introductory conversation is that the mentor and his/her protege get to know each other on personal and social basis. It helps in building the relationship and once the mentor is comfortable with mentee it also helps further. Typically, first conversation should be of 30 - 45 minutes. It can take place in person, on phone or possibly through e-mail.</p>

                            <p>As a mentee, you will play different roles during the course of your mentoring relationship. Trust your mentor and try to discuss issues openly. Remember he won't be able to give a solution until you discuss your doubt with your mentor. Identify your queries regarding your field of interest etc. Being clear in your doubts will help you to extract maximum from your mentor's experiences.It's a program launched for your benefits so take the most out of it and take full advantage to learn.</p>

                                <li><a href="#">Think, reflect, and communicate: Identify your goals, set your objectives and then ask your mentor for advice and feedback. Avoid perfectionism, be open-minded so that you can accept and learn from your mentor's feedback.</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Be positive and take initiative: Maintain a proactive attitude, give your best, and try to come up with new ideas to overcome problems, show enthusiasm and ambition. Strive to challenge yourself with new learning experiences.</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Establish a healthy relationship: Keep your mentor updated on what you are doing, how you put into practice his/her suggestions and the solutions you came up to. Be honest and open with your mentor. At the same time, set appropriate personal boundaries to prevent your mentoring relationship to become involved to an unhealthy degree (e.g. becoming overly emotionally involved with your mentor).</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Plan your time, yet remain flexible: Bear in mind that both you and your mentor might have a busy schedule. Be flexible when choosing meeting days and times and allow for your mentor commitments along with your ones. Make sure you organize yourself so that you can stay true to your commitment.</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Be grateful: Your mentor needs reinforcement, like you do! So, when you recognize that your mentor's advice is helpful, tell him! Give thanks and appreciation for any helpful piece of advice and information. Keep in mind that your mentor is investing time and effort without any financial gain just to support you!</a></li>
                            </ul>


<a class="link1" href="#">Don'ts for mentees</a>
                            <ul class="list2">
                                <li><a href="#">Set unrealistic objectives (your mentor is not a superhero!): - Don't think that by taking on the mentoring Programme you can achieve your goals overnight. Mentoring requires time. So, allow your mentor some time to help you overcome your challenges. Don't ask your mentor to identify your goals, carry out work for you, solve your problems and/or tell you exactly what to do.</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Forget good manners: Don't be impolite to your mentor. Don't let your mentor know about cancellation of meetings at the last minute. Try to plan your weekly schedule in a way to respect your commitment with your mentor</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Take your mentor's feedback for granted: Take your time to think it through, put a real thought on it and consider it with every care.</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Take it personally - Don't take any constructive criticism personally. Your mentor will only give you feedback to help you improve, not just for the sake of belittling you</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#">Hesitate to contact for ASMP support - Should you have any problems or issues with your mentor during the mentoring Programme (e.g. s/he does not reply to your message, you don't find him/her helpful at all), don't hesitate to contact us. We will try to find a solution.</a></li>
