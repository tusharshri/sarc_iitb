    Beyond the Horizons, an interaction with unconventional alumni who thought out-of-the-box and followed their dreams and took a different route.

The session aimed at providing the students a subconscious support through the examples of young trailblazers, inspiring them to become the future torchbearers.

IITs have proved that the holistic education it provides can not only make good engineers but also good musicians, sportsmen, photographers politicians, social workers, stand up comedians, directors and much much more. All it takes is the will power to realise your dream and the courage to take the road not taken. We brought alumni from all these walks of life to share their experiences and set an example as to how one can realise their true calling.

  <!-- Pannel Discussion --->
      A panel consisting of alumni, faculty and a student representative was invited to discuss on the topic : "The Unfulfilled Dream - Vision Behind IITs". <br />

Thought provoking discussion on one of the most despised, desired and debated topics in the institute, that of which career path to choose, made this an event not to be missed.<br />

We explored the pros and cons of the core and non core sectors and question the herd mentality of students.<br /><br />

Some of the points raised were - <br />
- THE Question - "Core, or non-core"<br />
- Are the students coming out of IITs today, just number-crunching
drones for corporates?<br />
- What do students take back from the campus life?<br />
- Is IITB moving away from it's original goal?<br /><br />

        So do IITs fulfill the dream? Do the students at IIT receive a holistic education or are we trained to be mindless computing droids?<br />

Our panel thought so. Us IITians contribute to the nation not just by being engineers, but being world class professionals in many other fields. <br />

  <!-- Panel Discussion -->  
  A new initiative of SARC, with the vision that passing out students can be benefited by experiencing mock interviews by alumni before they appear for their placement interviews.<br />

There was a 1 hour session by Mr. Anant Gupta on how to give a good and effective interview. It commenced with a public mock interview of a current student, followed by detailed analysis of the interview. <br />

This was followed by individual mock interviews, for the placement junta. The students were able to judge themselves after valuable feedback from alumni interviewers.<br />

Many of the interviewers have already come for placements in IIT on behalf of some of the biggest companies like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey.<br />

    Alumni Sports Day. The Annual Alumni Sports Day witnessed tremendous competition between the energy of
     the present generation and that of the alumni in last 2 years. 
  </p> <p>Alumni showed the perfect blend of attitude, experience and sporting spirit with some exceptional performances in all the sports. Results of last year's meet like the previous year were pretty much dominated by the alumni, winning in almost all the sports (this year we are going to give you a tough fight).
