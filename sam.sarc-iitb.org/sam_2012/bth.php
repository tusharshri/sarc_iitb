    <h2>SAM > Beyond the Horizons</h2>
    Beyond the Horizons is an interactive session that will take place during the Student Alumni Meet (SAM). Here, the alumni who took less conventional careers after passing out from this prestigious institute will interact with students. The speakers will be young alumni who thought out of the box and chose not to be “just another IITian”. The talks shall be aimed at providing the students a subconscious support through the examples of young trailblazers, not much different from them as a student, to be the future torch bearers.
     Here are some ways in which Beyond the Horizons will benefit the students:
    <ul>
    <li>It will expose the students to a completely new horizon of careers, other than the conventional ones.
    <li>The alumni will share their experiences and the critical decisions they made which completely transformed their lives. This will dispel the notion that a decent living can only be made by following the existing paths while unconventional career paths only cause hardship in the future.</li>
    <li>It will provide the students with ideas, innovations and creativity required to go for less travelled but really exciting paths.</li>
    <li>It will let the students know that there are others that have chosen such paths, and hence have someone to look at for guidance and inspiration.</li>
    </ul>
