		<p>Beyond the Horizon is an interaction with unconventional alumni who thought out-of-the-box and followed their dreams and took a different route. The session aimed at providing the students a subconscious support through the examples of young trailblazers, inspiring them to become the future torchbearers.<br><br>

		<p>As the name suggests, it is an ice-breaking session kept for mentors and mentees who are part of the Alumni Student Mentorship Program. Over lunch, mentors and their mentees have a face-to-face interaction and get to know one another thus breaking any inhibitions whatsoever. Around 100 alumni and 500+ students are expected for this event.<br><br>
